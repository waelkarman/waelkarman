### Hi there 👋🏻

I am computer engineering passionate. I am always keen on learning and reading about new technologies, and I might feel a little bit more interest in topics such as Software development, Algorithms and Systems. 

Pushing my limits and getting out of my comfort zone brought me powerful soft skills, such as: leadership, problem solving and decision making, presentation skills, and creativity and of course thirst for adventure.
