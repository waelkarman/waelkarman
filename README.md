### Hi there 👋🏻
This is my little workshop where I try out new things, bring ideas to life, put concepts into practice, and work on improving myself every day.

Pushing my limits and getting out of my comfort zone brought me powerful skills, such as: leadership, problem solving, decision making, tech skills, creativity and of course thirst for adventure.
