### Hi there 👋🏻

I am computer engineering passionate. I am always keen on learning and reading about new technologies, and I might feel a little bit more interest in topics such as Software development, Algorithms and Systems. 

Pushing my limits and getting out of my comfort zone brought me powerful soft skills, such as: leadership, problem solving and decision making, presentation skills, and creativity and of course thirst for adventure.

In my free time I love reading, hiking, programming and playing volleyball. I also keep an open door for new stuff (a new language, a new sport, a new activity). 

Each day I try to be better by at least 1% 💪🏻
